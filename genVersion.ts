/**
 * genVersion - THE single bump, for the whole programme (S3, Stage 10).
 *
 * Every science module built across Stages 1-9 plus the real morphology
 * implementations, `galacticDensity`, `placement`, `remnants`, `conatal` and
 * `sky` alters output relative to a galaxy generated before it existed - so
 * bumping per-module would have forced repeated regeneration for no
 * benefit. This is the ONE bump, landing here, now that the pipeline is
 * coherent (S3's own reasoning: "a fixture cut earlier would enshrine
 * pre-bump behaviour nobody intends to keep").
 *
 * `verification/golden/gen1.json` is the fixture cut against genVersion 1.
 *
 * BUMP 2, 15 Aug 2026 (patch v2.3): the spiral's density field is no longer
 * axisymmetric-in-effect - `spiralArms`/`starFormingComplexes` genuinely
 * change `densityAt`/`densityByPopulation` for `spiral`/`barredSpiral` at a
 * fixed (worldSeed, cell range), so every placed/remnant system's exact
 * density-derived draw budget and resulting position/population changes
 * relative to a gen-1 galaxy. `verification/golden/gen2.json` is the fixture
 * cut against THIS version - see `goldenMaster.conformance.ts`.
 *
 * NOT bumped again by anything built in this same pass.
